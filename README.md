# OnlineShopping_DataWarehouse

for our first semester final project in data warehousing 
and business intelligence module, we developed a data
warehouse. first we selected a data set on our own.
as the first step of the assignment the data was loaded 
to the staging database from the source db. then the data
was extracted from the staging db to the data warehouse
by using ETL tasks. data warehouse was developed with a fact
table and dimension tables.
